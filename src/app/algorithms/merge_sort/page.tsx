        Merge sort is an efficient, stable, and comparison-based sorting
        algorithm. Most implementations produce a stable sort, meaning that the
        implementation preserves the input order of equal elements in the sorted
        output. Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that was invented
        by John von Neumann in 1945.
